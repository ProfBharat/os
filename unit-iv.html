            File System Interface - The Concept of a File, Access methods,
            Directory Structure, File System Mounting, File Sharing, Protection,
            File System Structure, Mass Storage Structure - Overview of Mass
            Storage Structure, Disk Structure, Disk Attachment, Disk Scheduling.
            Concept of a File: In computing, a file is a named collection of
            related information stored on a storage medium, such as a hard disk,
            solid-state drive (SSD), or tape. Files can contain various types of
            data, such as text, images, videos, programs, or any other digital
            information. Files are organized into directories (folders) to
            provide a hierarchical structure for organizing and managing data.
            Access Methods: Access methods determine how files are read from or
            written to in a file system. Different access methods include:
            Sequential Access: Files are accessed sequentially from the
            beginning to the end. Data is read or written in a linear fashion.
            This method is suitable for files where data is processed in a
            specific order, like reading a text file line by line. Direct
            Access: Files are accessed randomly, allowing direct access to any
            part of the file without the need to read data sequentially. Each
            part of the file has a unique address or offset, making it possible
            to read or write data at any location. This method is useful for
            large files where quick access to specific data is required, like a
            database file. Indexing: Files are accessed using an index or key.
            An index structure maintains a mapping between the index value and
            the location of the data in the file. This method enables efficient
            retrieval of data based on the index value. It is commonly used in
            database systems. Directory Structure: A directory structure
            organizes files and directories in a hierarchical manner. It
            provides a way to group related files together and manage their
            organization. Common directory structures include: Single-Level
            Directory: All files are placed in a single directory without any
            subdirectories. This structure is simple but lacks organization and
            scalability. Two-Level Directory: Files are organized into groups,
            and each group has its own subdirectory. Each file is uniquely
            identified by its name and the name of the group directory.
            Tree-Structured Directory: Files are organized in a tree-like
            structure with a root directory at the top. Each directory can
            contain files and subdirectories, forming a hierarchical
            organization. Acyclic-Graph Directory: Allows files to have multiple
            links or pointers to different directories. This structure allows
            for shared files among directories but prevents cycles from
            occurring. File System Mounting: File system mounting is the process
            of making a file system available for access. When a file system is
            mounted, the operating system associates it with a specific mount
            point (a directory) within the overall directory structure. Once
            mounted, the files and directories within that file system become
            accessible to users and applications. File Sharing: File sharing
            enables multiple users or processes to access and use the same file
            simultaneously. It allows collaboration and concurrent access to
            files. File systems employ various mechanisms, such as file locks,
            to ensure data consistency and prevent conflicts when multiple users
            attempt to modify the same file simultaneously. Protection: File
            system protection involves mechanisms to control and manage access
            to files. Access control lists (ACLs), permissions, and
            user/group-level privileges are commonly used to enforce file-level
            security and restrict unauthorized access. Protection mechanisms
            ensure that only authorized users can read, write, or execute files
            based on their permissions. File System Structure: File system
            structure refers to the organization and layout of files and
            directories within a file system. Different file systems use various
            structures to manage and store data on storage devices. Common file
            system structures include: File Allocation Table (FAT): Used by the
            FAT file system, it maintains a table to track the allocation status
            of each file cluster on the disk. Indexed Allocation: Utilizes an
            index structure to store file addresses and pointers. The index maps
            each file to a set of disk block addresses. Unix File System (UFS):
            Organizes data into inodes (index nodes), which contain metadata
            about files and pointers to data blocks. New Technology File System
            (NTFS): Uses a master file table (MFT) to store file metadata, such
            as file attributes, permissions, and data extents. Overview of Mass
            Storage Structure: Mass storage refers to the storage of large
            amounts of data in a non-volatile manner. It serves as a repository
            for files, databases, operating systems, and other types of data
            that need to be preserved even when the power is turned off. Mass
            storage devices typically have higher capacity and are slower than
            primary storage (RAM). Some common types of mass storage devices
            include hard disk drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), optical
            drives (CD/DVD), and magnetic tapes. Disk Structure: Both hard disk
            drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SSDs) have a similar logical
            structure. The storage is divided into fixed-size units called
            sectors, and a group of sectors forms a block or cluster. Each
            sector typically stores a fixed number of bytes of data (512 bytes
            being the common size). The operating system uses a file system to
            manage these sectors and clusters, organizing data into files and
            directories. Disk Attachment: Disks can be attached to a computer
            system using various interfaces, depending on the type of disk and
            the capabilities of the system. Common disk attachment interfaces
            include: SATA (Serial ATA): Commonly used for internal hard drives
            and SSDs in modern computers. SAS (Serial Attached SCSI): Used for
            high-performance enterprise-level storage. PCIe (Peripheral
            Component Interconnect Express): Used for high-speed,
            direct-attached storage devices like NVMe SSDs. USB (Universal
            Serial Bus): Used for connecting external storage devices like USB
            flash drives and external hard drives. Thunderbolt: A high-speed
            interface used for connecting external storage devices and
            peripherals to Apple computers. Disk Scheduling: Disk scheduling is
            a technique used by the operating system to optimize the access and
            retrieval of data from disk storage. Disk access times consist of
            seek time (moving the read/write head to the desired track),
            rotational delay (waiting for the desired sector to rotate under the
            head), and transfer time (reading or writing the data). Efficient
            disk scheduling algorithms aim to minimize the seek time and
            rotational delay to improve overall disk I/O performance. Some
            commonly used disk scheduling algorithms include: First-Come,
            First-Served (FCFS): Requests are serviced in the order they arrive.
            It is simple but can lead to poor performance due to the "elevator
            effect," where the head moves back and forth across the disk.
            Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF): Selects the request with the
            shortest seek time from the current head position. It reduces seek
            time but may cause starvation for some requests. SCAN (Elevator)
            Algorithm: The head moves from one end of the disk to the other,
            servicing requests along the way. Once it reaches the other end, it
            reverses direction. This reduces the "elevator effect" but can lead
            to delayed servicing of some requests. C-SCAN (Circular SCAN)
            Algorithm: Similar to SCAN, but the head jumps back to the other end
            of the disk after reaching one end, without servicing requests. This
            avoids the delayed servicing problem of SCAN. LOOK Algorithm:
            Similar to SCAN but changes direction when there are no more
            requests in the current direction. It prevents the head from going
            to the end of the disk unnecessarily. C-LOOK Algorithm: Similar to
            C-SCAN but changes direction when there are no more requests in the
            current direction. It avoids unnecessary head movement of the C-SCAN
            algorithm.
