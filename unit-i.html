            <ol>
                  <li>
                        <p><b>Memory Management</b>: The OS allocates and manages computer
                        memory to ensure efficient utilization and protection of processes
                        from interfering with one another. It handles memory allocation,
                        deallocation, and swapping processes in and out of memory as needed.</p>
                        <br /></br>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                        <p><b>Processor Management</b>: The OS schedules and manages the
                        execution of processes, ensuring fair and efficient utilization of
                        CPU resources. It allocates CPU time to different processes and
                        manages their state transitions.</p>
                  </li>
                  <br><br /></br>
                  <li>
                        <p><b>Device Management</b>: The OS controls and coordinates the use of
                        hardware devices such as printers, disks, and network interfaces. It
                        provides a standardized interface for software applications to
                        access these devices without needing to understand their low-level
                        details.</p>
                  </li>
                  <br><br /></br>
                  <li>
                        <p><b>File System Management:</b> The OS manages the storage and
                        organization of files on secondary storage devices (e.g., hard
                        drives). It provides a hierarchical structure for file storage,
                        maintains metadata about files (e.g., permissions, ownership, and
                        timestamps), and ensures data integrity and security.</p> <br /></br>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                        <p><b>User Interface:</b> The OS provides a user interface that allows users
                        to interact with the computer system. This interface can be a
                        command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI),
                        enabling users to execute commands, run applications, and manage
                        <br>files and settings. <br /></br></p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                        <p><b>Process</b> Management: The OS creates, executes, and terminates
                        processes (instances of running programs). It provides mechanisms
                        for process synchronization and communication to allow processes to
                        cooperate and share data when needed.</p>
                  </li>
                  <br><br /></br>
                  <li>
                        <p><b>Security</b>: The OS enforces security measures to protect the
                        system and its data from unauthorized access, malicious software,
                        and other security threats. This includes user authentication,
                        <br>access control, and data encryption.</br></p>
                  </li>
                  <br />
                  <li>
                        <p><b>Fileand Data Access: </b> The OS manages data access, ensuring
                        that applications can read and write to files while preventing data
                        corruption or conflicts between concurrent processes accessing the
                        <br>same files.</br></p>
                  </li>
                  <br />
                  <li>
                        <p><b>Error Handling: </b> The OS detects and handles errors and
                        exceptions that may occur during the execution of programs or
                        interactions with hardware. It attempts to recover from errors and
                        <br>prevent system crashes or data loss.</br></p>
                        <br />

                  <li>
                        <p><b>Virtualization</b>: Some modern operating systems support
                        virtualization, enabling the creation of multiple virtual machines
                        (VMs) on a single physical machine. These VMs can run separate
                        operating systems and applications, allowing for more efficient
                        hardware utilization and better resource isolation.</p>

            <br />
            <ol>
                  <li>
                        <p><b>Simple</b>: In the context of computing, "simple" typically
                        refers to a straightforward, easy-to-understand, or uncomplicated
                        design or implementation. It often implies a system or solution that
                        lacks complexity or advanced features. Simplicity is often favored
                        when it leads to more manageable systems, better maintainability,
                        and reduced chances of errors.</p></br>
                  </li>
                  <br />
                  <li>
                        <p><b>Batch</b>: Batch processing refers to a method where data or
                        tasks are collected, processed, and executed in groups or batches
                        rather than individually or interactively. Batch processing is
                        commonly used for large-scale, repetitive tasks, such as data
                        processing, bulk printing, or file transfers. Instead of processing
                        one item at a time, batch systems process a collection of items in a
                        single operation, making it more efficient for certain types of
                        tasks.</p></br>
                  </li>
                  <br />
                  <li>
                        <p><b>Multi-programmed:</b> Multi-programming, as mentioned before, is
                        a technique used in operating systems to maximize CPU utilization by
                        simultaneously executing multiple programs or processes. It allows
                        the operating system to keep the CPU busy even when certain programs
                        are waiting for I/O operations or other resources. By interleaving
                        the execution of different programs, multi-programming can enhance
                        <br>overall system performance.</p></br>
                        <br />
                  </li>
                  <li>
                        <p><b>Time-shared: </b> Time-sharing is a method of computing where
                        multiple users interact with a single computer or system
                        concurrently. Each user is given a small time slice or quantum
                        during which they can execute commands and access resources on the
                        shared system. The operating system rapidly switches between users,
                        giving the illusion of real-time responsiveness and ensuring fair
                        <br>resource allocation among multiple users.</p></br>
                        <br />
                  </li>
                  <li>
                        <p><b>Parallel</b>: Parallel computing involves the simultaneous
                        execution of multiple tasks or processes to achieve faster and more
                        efficient computation. This is typically accomplished by dividing a
                        large problem into smaller subproblems, and each subproblem is
                        solved simultaneously on multiple processing units (e.g., CPU cores,
                        GPUs, or even separate computers). Parallelism can significantly
                        reduce the time required to complete complex tasks, making it a
                        <br>valuable approach for computationally intensive applications.</p></br>
                        <br />
                  </li>
                 <li>
                       <p><b>Distributed Systems: </b> Distributed systems are collections of
                        interconnected computers or nodes that collaborate and share
                        resources to accomplish a common objective. Each node operates
                        autonomously and communicates with others through a network. The
                        distribution of tasks and data across multiple nodes allows for
                        scalability, fault tolerance, and improved performance. Distributed
                        systems are often used in large-scale applications like cloud
                        computing, peer-to-peer networks, and distributed databases.</p></br>

                  <li>
                        <p><b>Real-Time Systems</b><b>:</b> Real-time systems are computing
                        systems designed to respond to events or inputs within strict time
                        constraints. They must produce results or actions within
                        predetermined time limits to ensure correct operation and safety.
                        
                        Real-time systems are used in various critical applications, such as
                        industrial control systems, aviation, medical devices, and
                        autonomous vehicles, where timely responses are essential to avoid
                        dangerous situations or system failures.</p>
